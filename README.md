# Welcome to Coast

## What is this?

Coast is a full stack web framework written in Clojure for small teams or solo developers. It uses a relational database and renders html on the server without javascript which allows you to ship your web applications faster.

## Getting Started

### Installation on Mac

1. Make sure clojure is installed first

```bash
brew install clojure
```

2. Install the coast cli script

```bash
curl -o /usr/local/bin/coast https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coast-framework/coast/master/coast && chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/coast
```

3. Create a new coast project

```bash
coast new myapp && cd myapp && make server
```



### Installation on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Make sure you have bash, curl, rlwrap, and Java installed

```bash
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.9.0.391.sh
chmod +x linux-install-1.9.0.391.sh
sudo ./linux-install-1.9.0.391.sh
```

2. Install the coast cli script

```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/coast https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coast-framework/coast/master/coast && sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/coast
```

3. Create a new coast project

```

You should be greeted with the text "You're coasting on clojure!"
when you visit `http://localhost:1337`
